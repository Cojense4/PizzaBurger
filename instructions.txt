1. Do one of the following:
    A) Clone your Programming Assignment 2 submission - it should have been set up for Maven.
    B) Clone the starter code for Programming Assignment 2 (or make a copy of your Exercise 7) and put into a Maven folder structure.
2. Create a folder structure: src/test/java.
3. Create a PizzaTest class and place it under src/test/java/..., under the folder corresponding to Pizza.java.
4. Write PizzaTest to check if the sorting method actually sorted
    the Pizza.PizzaComponent MenuItems. (You'll need to check the
    property that each menu item's price is less than or equal to
    the one next to it.)
